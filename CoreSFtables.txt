SF Objects are structered as fields(columns) and records(lines)

Core Objects (in debatable order of general importance):

Account

Contact

Opportunity

Case

Lead

Activity (Task/Event)

EmailMessage

Campaign

CampaignMember

Relationships:

1 Account can have zero or many child Contacts, Opportunities, Activities, and Cases

1 Account can itself have zero or many child Accounts or zero or 1 parent Account

1 Case can have zero or many child EmailMessages and child Activities

1 Lead can have zero or many child Activities

1 Lead explodes into 3 separate objects when converted: 1 Account with 1 child contact & 1 child opportunity

1 Campaign can have zero or many child Lead or Contacts joined through a junction object called CampaignMember. This means 1 Lead or Contact can be part of zero or many campaigns and vice-versa (1 Campaign can have 0 or many Leads or Contacts)

There's a lot more to it than that but these are the basics.
